    "Remark: The description of the original RSA paper is slightly different from Boneh & Shoup. Specifically, in Boneh & Shoup, $e$ is given as the input and one tries to compute $d$ based on $e$. On the other hand, RSA requires $d$ to be a large number. The rationale of the choice in RSA is so that the attacker cannot simply try all small $d$'s to decrypt the message (this can be a problem if the message has a certain format, e.g., http header, so that the attacker knows that it succeeded when the ciphertext decrypts to that format). \n",

    "In practice, even if one chooses $e$ and $d$ randomly, the chance of getting a small $d$ is small. So this is not a big concern. Though additional sanity checks are always helpful to make the implementation more secure!"
