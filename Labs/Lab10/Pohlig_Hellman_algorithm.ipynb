    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, you will implement [the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm](https://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/28.pdf) which efficiently computes discrete logarithms in a [finite abelian group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group#Finite_abelian_groups) whose order is a [smooth integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_number). The Pohlig-Hellman algorithm is the reason why the prime $p$ and the generator $g$ in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange need to be picked carefully (so that the order of the group $G$, which equals to $p-1$, has a large prime factor $q$, and the generator has order $q$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a bit more detail, the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm works as follows. Suppose one is trying to solve the discrete logarithm $y = g^x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$ where $p-1 = p_{0} \\times p_{1} \\times \\ldots \\times p_{k-1}$ ($p_i$'s are prime numbers. For simplicity, assume that they are all distinct for now.).\n",
    "The Pohlig-Hellman algorithm is a divide and conquer problem that finds $x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p_1), x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p_2), \\ldots, x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p_{k-1})$. And from there, $x (\\text{mod} \\ p_{0} \\times p_{1} \\times \\ldots \\times p_{k-1}) = x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p-1)$. We explain the core idea in finding $x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p_i)$ below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding $x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p_i)$\n",
    "Consider the following concrete example where $p = 2 \\times 5 \\times 7 + 1$ and $g = 11$. $g$ has order $p-1$ (Check that yourself!). \n",
    "The key observation is that for some special powers of $g$, say $g^t$, the order of $g^t$ is much smaller, and the discrete logarithm problem is much simpler with $g^t$ as the generator. There is nothing mysterious about $t$. You can verify yourself that if $t = 2 \\times 5$, $g^t$ has order $7$; $t = 5 \\times 7$, $g^t$ has order $2$; and $t = 2 \\times 7$, $g^t$ has order $5$! \n",
    "\n",
    "How does the fact help us? Suppose the discrete logarithm we are trying to solve is $g^x = g^{13} = 63 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$. What we can do now is to raise the equation to the power $t=2 \\times 5$. So ${g^x}^t = 63^t = 20 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$. But ${g^x}^t = g^{xt} = {g^t}^x$. So solving the discrete logarithm with $g^t$ as the generator gives us $x \\ (\\text{mod} 7)$. We can do the same with $t = 5 \\times 7$ and $t = 2 \\times 7$ to find $x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 2)$ and $x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 5)$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that is left to explain is how to solve the easier instances of the discrete logarithm problem. You can do that with the baby-step giant-step algorithm you have seen in the class!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding $x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p_{0} \\times p_{1} \\times \\ldots \\times p_{k-1})$\n",
    "Once we know $x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p_i)$ for each $i$, we can compute $x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p_{0} \\times p_{1} \\times \\ldots \\times p_{k-1})$ by using the [Chinese remainder theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem). That effectively solves the original discrete problem $g^x \\ (\\text{mod} \\ p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remark\n",
    "So how do you know the factorization of $p-1$ in the first place? Didn't we say that factorization of a large (2048-bit) integer is hard?\n",
    "Yes, factorization is hard in general. But since we only require $p$ to be a prime, there is no guarantee that $p-1$ does not have small factors. The Pohlig-Hellman algorithm *assumes* that $p-1$ can be factorized into small factors and small factors only (that is what a smooth integer means). In other words, the attack does not work against all instances of Diffie-Hellman key exchange (in the version where the generator $g$ is picked randomly), but when it works, it is devastating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "In this programming assignment, you will implement the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm in its full generality. You should fully understand the reasons behind the choice of prime $q$ and the generator $g$ after the programming assignment."

    "The assignment is broken down into four components. In the first component, you will implement exponentiation by squaring as a warm-up. Then, you will implement the baby-step giant-step algorithm as you have seen in the class. After that, you will implement a simplified version of the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm where $p-1 = p_1^{e_1}$ ($p_1$ is a prime, $e_1$ is an arbitrary positive integral exponent). Finally, you will extend your implementation to the general case where $p-1 = \\prod_i p_i^{e_i}$.\n"

    "You can check the correctness of your implementation with small prime factors (make sure your $p$ is a prime!). The correctness of your implementation will be checked against larger prime factors (48-bit or more). You can generate primes by implementing the Miller-Rabin primality test yourself (recommended for your understanding) or use the `getPrime()` function from the `PyCryptodome` library (https://www.pycryptodome.org/src/util/util#Crypto.Util.number.getPrime)."
