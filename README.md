### 0. General Techniques
- Prove that a simple scheme is secure with respect to a security notion.
- If a scheme is not secure with respect to a security notion, show a concrete attack against the security notion
- Given a scheme, analyze its efficiency. For example, the number of keys required for the scheme, number of PRF evaluations needed by the scheme, for an encryption scheme, if the encryption/decryption can be parallelized and so on.
