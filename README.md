## Examinable Material
### 1. Encryption
- Definition of Shannon cipher.
- Definition of perfect security.
- One-time pad and its limitations.
- Prove if a cipher is perfectly secure or not.
- Definition of computational cipher.
- Definition of semantic security (standard and bit-guessing).
- Given that $\mathcal{E}$ is semantically secure, prove that $\mathcal{E}$ (that is a simple variant of $\mathcal{E}$) is (or is not) semantically secure.
- Prove that semantic security is stronger than weaker notions of security.


### 2. Stream Ciphers
- Definition of pseuodo-random generators (PRGs).
