## Examinable Material
### 1. Encryption
- Definition of Shannon Cipher.
- Definition of perfect security.
- One-time pad and its limitations.
- Prove if a cipher is perfectly secure or not.
- Definition of Computational Cipher.
- Definition of semantic security (standard and bit-guessing).
- Given that $\mathcal{E}$ is semantically secure, prove that $\mathcal{E}$ (that is a simple variant of $\mathcal{E}$) is (or is not) semantically secure.
- Prove that semantic security is stronger than weaker notions of security.


### 2. Stream ciphers
- Definition of Pseuodo-random generators (PRGs).
- Definition of PRG security.
- Given that $G$ is a secure PRG, prove (or disprove) that $G'$ (that is a simple variant of $G$) is a secure PRG.
- Informally argue why stream cipher is semantically secure.
- Reproduce the parallel and sequential compositions of PRGs. Informally argue about their security.
